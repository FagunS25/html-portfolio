<p>Hi, My name is Fagun Suhag and I am an ever eloving breed of a learner. I have completed my graduation in Management Studies in 2020 and since then or even before I have been involved with a lot of activities namely, art, content, acting, singing, rapping, being a teacher and an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>I have around 2.5 years of experience in sales, 1.5 years of experience in customer service and I have also worked as a personal tutor for over 2 years, apart from that I take freelance projects as a video editor and digital marketing manager.</p>

<p>I have completed a professional course on data analytics from Trainity and Internshala where I learnt excel, mysql and python. I went on to learn power bi to be efficient in creating an eye pleasing dashboard for upper level management. I have also mastered various other tools in video editing and grapic design like davinci, adobe premier pro, adobe after effecst, illustrator, basic blender, and canva. Currently I am learning how to develop a website from a scratch as I would want to use this knowledge to help everyone around me and myself for my own businesses as my long term vision involves making India smart and not let accessiblity be a problem for anyone in my country! </p>
<p>I have been dedicated to learning new tools and technologies in order to keep up with the technology and be useful for the world around me. I was born in a small town of Gujarat, India called Bhavnagar. I was fortunate enough to have completed my education in Mumbai which is a metropolitan city in India (just like owr own New York) and currently I have been managing multiple businesses for my firend, family and clients. I look forward to incorporating all of my skills to develop a business and a path to success. For now I am learning html5 and later I will learn other tools  like java, css, and other front end and backend tools to make and develop a website as well as a software which is fully functional!</p>
