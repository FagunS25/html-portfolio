<h1>The Best Movies According to Fagun</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr/>
<h3>The White Tiger</h3>
I like the satirical themes in the movie along with a touch of reality.
It accurately depicts the divide between society.
<h3>Grave Of The Fireflies</h3>
It is an anime set back in time for Japan and exploits your emotions if you connect with the characters.
 It is not a fun or a happy anime film but definately worth your time if you like to learn about the nuances of life. 
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
This is a proper bollywood movie which includes light fun, love, sadness, satirical poetry and poetic justice.
It is about a group of guy friends reuniting after a long time to go on an international trip, where they encounter the differences amongst each other.
And end up realising why they became friends in the first place after a little drama and learning from each other's lives.
